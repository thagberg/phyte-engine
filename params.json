{"name":"Phyte-engine","tagline":"2D fighting game engine and Qt GUI toolkit built in Python, PyGame, and Qt","body":"### Create custom fighting games without dedicated programmer help\r\nPhyte Engine includes a dynamic entity-component based fighting game engine runtime and a toolkit which allows game designers to define entities, components, rules, and states without needing to write a lot of code.\r\n\r\n### Entity-Component architecture\r\nAn entity-component based runtime architecture enables a great deal of flexibility in the kinds of games which can be designed.  This means that the Phyte Engine system supports traditional 1vs1 2D \"street brawling\" style fighting games, or even more frantic party-game styled arena fighting games.\r\n\r\n### Pipelined toolkit process\r\nThe toolkit supports a pipelined process, which allows designers to string together dependent entities and components with ease.  The runtime will recognize the relationships between components for use in the game.\r\n\r\n### Permissive Open Source License\r\nAn MIT license is applied to the Phyte Engine runtime and toolkit code, which means it can be used for free or commercial projects.\r\n\r\n### Installation Dependencies\r\nThe engine runtime depends on the PyGame open source library, and the toolkit depends on Qt 3.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
